Teknoy Trails (Tek-trails) is a virtual pet game inspired by Pou. 
This game aims to merge study sessions in a game where you can manage your own character's well being. 
This also has a feature to maneuver around the CIT-U campus in order to familiarize the university buildings. 
Let's make your study and game sessions in a single game.
